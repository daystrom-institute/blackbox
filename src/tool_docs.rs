//! Single source of truth for the agent-facing tool reference.
//!
//! Every `bbox_*` / `bro_*` MCP tool registered in `main.rs` must have
//! a matching stanza in `TOOL_DOCS`. A unit test enforces this.
//!
//! On daemon startup, `sync_into_knowledge` upserts a fixed-ID global
//! knowledge entry (`bb-tool-reference`) rendered from `TOOL_DOCS` +
//! `WORKFLOW_NOTES`. That entry lands in `~/.claude-shared/CLAUDE.md`
//! / `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` / `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` on the next
//! `bbox_render` pass so every agent on every project sees a current
//! tool map.
//!
//! Adding or changing a tool = one edit here. No hand-curated drift.

## Retrieval cues

If a tool stanza says `See: sm-...`, fetch that runbook on demand with \
`bbox_knowledge(query=\"sm-...\")`. Keep primitive semantics hot; pull deep \
workflow guidance only when you need it.

## Roles and the core loop

- **Orchestrator** — dispatches, reviews, reads `bbox_inbox`, resolves notes, \
and records durable commitments.
- **Executor** — does the work, emits sparse high-signal `bbox_note` entries, \
and always emits `kind=done`.

## Ambient scope block

Dispatched agents receive pre-bound IDs (`session`, `project`, `bro`, and \
sometimes `thread` / `work_item`). Use them instead of reconstructing context \
from transcript history.

## Hot-path conventions

- List before create.
- `bro_exec` starts fresh; `bro_resume` continues.
- `bbox_learn` is for user-stated standing rules; `bbox_note(kind=learned)` is \
for agent-discovered facts.
