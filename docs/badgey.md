# Retired Badgey integration

Badgey instances, proposals and consultant automation are retired. Use corpus retrieval directly, or dispatch a focused worker and compose review in the caller. Retained indexed conversation evidence remains searchable.

Blackbox retains bro execution, resume, cancellation, status and waits. The
caller owns sequencing, gates, retries, schedules and integrations, using its
own code and harness tools. No daemon workflow is needed to compose bro calls.

See [bro runtime](bro-runtime.md) for the surviving execution primitives and
[the retirement contract](../design/orchestration/bro-execution-boundary-and-retirement.md)
for history and ownership guarantees.
