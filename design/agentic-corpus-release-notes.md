# Agentic Corpus Release Notes

## F3

- Tantivy schema version `agentic-corpus-f3` adds agentic-corpus fields and
  drops the derived transcript index on first daemon start after upgrade.
- The background reindexer rebuilds from immutable transcript sources; search
  may report an empty index until that first rebuild commits.

## F4

- Artifact JSON uses a monotonic integer `version` field. The catalog stores it
  as metadata text so later semver-like strings can be accepted without a
  storage migration.
- Workflows, packets, and brofiles installed through the artifact catalog are
  copied under `$BLACKBOX_STATE_DIR/artifacts/<kind>/<name>.json` with
  `<kind>/<name>/metadata.json` tracking install source and supersession state.
